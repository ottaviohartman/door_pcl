# Door Detection with Point Clouds
###Ottavio Hartman
This is a repository which uses [Robot Operating System](http://www.ros.org/) (ROS) to find the location of doors in a point cloud captured by LIDAR. This is all work done at the University of Pennsylvania's [Kod*lab](http://kodlab.seas.upenn.edu/)

The packages `tilt_laser` and `door_pcl` use ROS along with [Point Cloud Library](http://pointclouds.org/) to detect a door and handle using a LIDAR scanner.
